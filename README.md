## Bayesian Inference on 2 Real Life Problems
Bayesian decision theory provides a unified and intuitively appealing approach to drawing inferences from observations and making rational, informed decisions. Bayesians view statistical inference as a problem in belief dynamics, using of evidence about a phenomenon to revise and update knowledge about it. Bayesian statistics is a scientifically justifiable way to integrate informed expert judgment with empirical data. For a Bayesian, statistical inference cannot be treated entirely independently of the context of the decisions that will be made on the basis of the inferences. In recent years, Bayesian method have become increasingly common in a variety of disciplines that rely heavily on data

Here I am solving 2 real life problems thats shows my capabilities in doing Bayesian Inference using R language

## Yelp Restaurants Reviews Analysis
Thousands of users leave a review for places they visit, give honest feedback about what they liked and what might need improvement. For businesses to pay attention to these reviews manually is a task which is why some technique that will help them draw conclusions is the need of the hour. I have applied data mining and modeling techniques on yelp dataset to analyze the customer reviews and extract meaningful results out of them.The goal of the project is to classify reviews as good or bad by applying Classfication Tree on the dataset and explore the attributes resulting in good or bad rating of US restaurants.
